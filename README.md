## Introduction

Minecraft is a sandbox game developed by Mojang. This project seeks to recreate Minecraft's gameplay mechanics using C++, providing insights into game development and system design. It is an educational project and is not intended for commercial use.

## Features

- **Block-based world generation**: Create and manipulate a world made up of different types of blocks.
- **Player interaction**: Move around the world, place, and remove blocks.
- **Basic physics**: Implement basic gravity and collision detection.
- **Procedural terrain generation**: Generate varied landscapes using noise algorithms.

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler**: A modern C++ compiler (C++17 or higher).
- **CMake**: Version 3.10 or higher.
- **SFML**: Simple and Fast Multimedia Library for handling graphics, input, and windowing.
- **GLM**: OpenGL Mathematics library for handling mathematics operations.

## Installation

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/minecraft-cpp.git
cd minecraft-cpp
```

## Build the project

### Create a build directory:

```bash
mkdir build
